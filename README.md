The CMAKE Tutorial
------------------

This is just the hand-coded result of following
[The CMake Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/).  I've
extensively commented my <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files so that if I
need to review the material, I'll have my own (hopefully sensible) words
to guide my understanding.  I expect to be doing a lot more C/C++ in the
coming months, and this was one of my starting points.

Status
------

This project is **completed**.  No new work is being considered.

Using
-----

Do the tutorial instead.  The only thing I had to look up was Newton's
square root algorithm; I ended up using the one out of
[SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), as you
might be able to guess from the variable names.
